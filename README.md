# Cirim
Unity game for Android/iOS

The goal of this game is to create an alternative puzzle with cirles as the main objects. The idea is that you rotate various rings around and swap the segments of 2 rings around until their colour segments match above each other and in that way complete the level. The game will then be composed of many levels which varies the number of rings and segments. The difficulty of the games shall of course be progressive. 

An additional feature that will be included in the future is colour swap, where the swap will not occur between the two adjacent segments but with the segment whose colour of the arrow matches the colour of the arrow you clicked on. But when you click on one double arrow, it will swap both sides with the segments alligned with respective colours of the arrows. 

The game will be free for users on both Android and iOS.
